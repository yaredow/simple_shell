## simple_shell
a simple command line prompt that takes the most basics of commands that are present in the bash shell and runs them. This shell was built as a project for ALX software engineering School.
## Description :speech_balloon:
**Simple_shell** is a simple UNIX command language interpreter that reads commands from either a file or standard input and executes them.
### Invocation :running:
To invoke **Simple_shell**, compile all `.c` files in the repository and run the resulting executable:
```
gcc *.c -o filename
```
**Simple_shell** can be invoked both interactively and non-interactively. If **shellby** is invoked with standard input not connected to a terminal, it reads and executes received commands in order.

Example:
```
$ echo "echo 'hello'" | ./filename
'hello'
$
```
